If caller is on scene, is the caller in a safe area, or exposed to shooter?
Can caller get to a secure area safely? If not, are you able to shelter in place? Where are you sheltering in place?

Shooting calls can be very dangerous for all responders, and active shooters present a special set of challenges. It is
imperative that you keep abreast of what the agency response plan includes, as well as what the scene responders expect
of dispatch. (Active Shooter Response classes are frequently held as part of CE requirements.) Active shooter situations
are not a specialized response. Active shooters are a patrol dilemma. It will be regular duty patrol that will be
responding and handling the situation.
Early warning signs that a call may be an active shooter include;
An onslaught of calls in a compact period of time
Open line calls with muffled sounds
Sounds of shots being fired without a caller speaking
Seemingly unrelated explosion of fire calls that begin to form a pattern on a mapping system
Fire alarms (latest strategy is to pull an alarm inside to drive victims outside to a waiting sniper)
Special considerations Communications Personnel need to take regarding response:
Number of shooters and location updates
Where to send/position responders for containment and safety
Secondary issues such as snipers, bombs, hostage taking
Escaping suspects
Large groups of people moving in an out of the area and the anticipated effect thereof.
Safety for responders at triage areas b/c of amount of emotional response within those areas
Evacuations or sheltering in place plans and the special needs of each
Traffic control
Alarms
Explosions and fires in conjunction with shooter activity
THE MEDIA. The media will ALWAYS be an interference during call processing and response. You will likely
receive as many calls from the media as you do from the public and victims on scene. Quick establishment of a
PIO or media notification system is integral and should be a priority of your incident command. Current trend is for
PIO/IC to use social media to make quick and effective regular updates.
Questioning / Dispatching techniques and considerations:
Active shooter incidents will be chaotic and panicked. It is imperative that you exercise repetitive persistence and
take command of the call. Establish control so that you can quickly obtain and relay information.
Once a call is determined to be an active shooter situation, call for 10-3 traffic. Securing the channel for emergency
traffic related to the call only is imperative.

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER MANUAL

CALL SPECIFIC QUESTIONING
ACTIVE SHOOTING RESPONSE (cont.’d)
Questioning / Dispatching techniques and considerations:
An active shooter incident should be dispatched like a lawn mower theft that should’ve been called in 2 weeks ago:
CALM, COLLECTED & with as LITTLE EMOTION as possible. (One key to remaining calm is to understand on
scene operations.)
Remember the formula: 5W + H + W + H + I (Where, What, Who, When, Why, How, Weapons, Hazards, Injuries)
Repeat radio transmissions. Repeat yours, and repeat theirs back to them. Active shooter events often have
multiple distractions (alarms, injured victims, etc.) and repeating transmissions helps both communications and
responder personnel focus, as well as repeats anything that they may have missed due to those distractions.
Keep abreast of any off-duty responders that may be responding after hearing the call out. Obtain descriptions and
information on those off-duty officers and relay it expeditiously to the on-duty responders enroute to the scene to
avoid off-duty responders being mistaken as suspects or additional victims.
While responders are enroute, DO update shooter information, location and description as it changes. Often,
active shooter incidents move incredibly fast, so accurate and timely updates on suspect and threat information is
vital. You do far more good by focusing attention on gathering and giving information because harm has already
been done to the victim.
Medical information and updates take a back seat until the shooter is neutralized. Dispatch should obtain number
of injured, casualties and injury type, but that information should be held until the shooter is down or in custody.
Once officers have made entry to the scene, having the control to remain silent on the radio is critical to officer
safety. Radio transmissions could give away the responder location to the shooter.
Status checks are made only according to operations protocol. If there is no specific preferred policy established
by IC, then every 10-15 minutes is a good general standard unless a team is clearing a building or area. In that
case, radio silence is priority.
Unless the caller tells you they are hiding and “sheltering in place,” try and obtain caller information. If they are
hiding and sheltering, and it is not safe to talk, then try to obtain clues about shooter information from background
noise. Dispatch should try to give callers the reason to stay away from arriving responders to avoid the risk of the
lifeguard effect (when citizens either grab onto or use as shields the police responders trying to locate the shooter).
Additionally, remind them to avoid clinging to the responder if the responder arrives to evacuate them. Simply
follow the direct orders of the responder and do not cling unless specifically instructed to by the responder to
remain close. If the caller makes the choice to run, or evacuate the premise to a safe place, update the responders
and again remind the caller to avoid grabbing responders or using them as shields, but instead to follow any
instructions given by police without hesitation.
Once the shooter is down or neutralized, dispatch can focus information giving to the casualties or the wounded.
Once the shooter is down or neutralized, holding the perimeter is critical and control at the staging and triage area
is vital to responder safety.
Work with your team in the communications center to sort out and coordinate information before giving it out on
the radio, both during the initial calls and response and during the aftermath/shooter neutralized phase.

CALL SPECIFIC QUESTIONING
BANK ALARM
Response:
2 PD unit minimum and Shift Commander (Dispatch Supervisor will be notified if it is determined a robbery has
occurred or is in progress.)
The following is the procedure that will used to dispatch and handle ALL bank alarms. Personnel at all banking/financial
institutions in Ruidoso have been trained in these procedures.
1. Broadcast “921” and indicate location by address only. (DO NOT broadcast the name of the bank on the radio.
If an officer requests the name of the business, advise them to 10-21 for that information.) Call units for response,
assuring that at least one of the backup units is the shift commander.
2. Upon field units’ arrival at the location, they will indicate their position around the bank and then request dispatch
to “start procedures.” The channel will be called 10-3 and closed for 10-33 traffic only at that time.
PROCEDURES:
Ø The dispatcher will call the bank and ask for extension 900. Asking for ext. 900 will alert the answering party that
a silent alarm has been activated and that a designated bank official should be placed on the line. (Dispatch should
always remain on alert for an impersonation of a bank representative.) The bank official should then survey the
bank interior, without causing any unnecessary suspicion or alarm. (The line should be left open during this
process, NEVER disconnected.) After doing so, the bank official will then indicate the situation in the following
manner:
o Under duress (robbery occurring): Bank official will reply, “I’m sorry. He is not in. Could you call back?”
o Not under duress (no robbery): Bank official will need only to re-identify themselves and indicated the
probable reason for the alarm.
Ø Dispatch will update field units immediately as to the type of response, either positive (robbery) or negative (no
robbery). Extreme care must be taken to ensure that radio communications are not heard over the open phone
line.
Ø If a reported or suspected robbery is NOT in progress, the dispatcher will obtain a full physical description of the
bank official and then instruct him/her to exit a designated bank door to meet with field units for de-briefing. The
field units should be immediately notified of the description and which door at which to meet the bank official.
Ø Responders will remain concealed until the designated bank official appears outside the facility for debriefing.
Officer WILL NOT follow officials back into the building. Rifles and/or shotguns will be carried into the bank at the
discretion of the responders.
Ø IF A ROBBERY HAS OCCURRED: Field units will be immediately updated as to the situation and dispatch will
follow instructions of the field units accordingly. Chief and incident command staff should also be notified at this
time, as well as Dispatch Supervisor.

IN CASE YOU ARE NOTIFIED OF A ROBBERY PRIOR TO RESPONDERS ARRIVING:
If the bank telephones before responders arrive and advise that a robbery has taken place, and the suspects have fled,
the dispatcher should obtain a description of the suspects, their vehicle and the direction of travel. They should also obtain
information regarding type and number of weapons, and whether or not the weapons were actually displayed or if the
robbery suspects simply indicated that they were armed.
The bank employee should be kept on the line and as much additional information as possible should be obtained and
forwarded to responders promptly.
If a hostage situation is in existence, suspects should be allowed to exit and move away from the building. Officers are to
remain concealed and protect bystanders. SUSPECTS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE LOCATION WITH
HOSTAGES.
*** NOTE:
The dissemination of information contained in this procedure is restricted to designated personnel of the Ruidoso Police Department.
Any unauthorized dissemination or disclosure may result in appropriate disciplinary and/or criminal court action.

BOMB RESPONSE POLICY
It is the policy of the Ruidoso Police Department to respond to reports of actual or threatened use of
bombs, explosive devices, or abandoned or found explosives, in an attempt to reduce the risk to
persons and property to the greatest extent possible.
PROCEDURE:
A. In any incident where an explosive or suspected explosive device is located, responding officers will not handle,
or closely approach the device.
B. The officer should refrain from using communications equipment (including mobile telephone) within 100 YARDS
of the device or location where a bomb threat has been received. (Electromagnetic energy emitted by the radios
and cellular telephones may activate the device.)
C. Officers will assist with the evacuation of persons who are in the vicinity of the device. It is not possible to know
prior to the explosion how large an area must be evacuated. Thus, officers must rely on common sense judgment
in advising evacuated persons where to relocate.
D. Upon discovery of a device or suspected device:
1. The shift supervisor will respond to the incident location, if not already present.
2. The shift supervisor will make notification to the operations lieutenant.
E. Upon discovery of explosives, improvised explosive device, suspected device or evidence which might indicate
the presence of an explosive device; or after the explosion of the device, the New Mexico State Police EOD
(Bomb Unit) (575-382-2511) will be requested to assist or respond. In the event the NMSP EOD unit is
unavailable, one of the following will be requested to assist:
1. Holloman AFB EOD (Holloman AFB, NM)
PS: (575) 572-5406
2. US Army EOD (Ft. Bliss, TX)
PS: (915) 568-8905
F. Upon discovery and after response and investigation by the Ruidoso Police Department and/or alternate disposal
units, it shall be the decision of one or more of those personnel as to the disposition of the device or explosives.
G. If bomb personnel determine the threat of detonation of the device/explosives to be minimal, disarming and/or
removal of the device/explosives may be made to a safe area for destruction or dismantling.
H. If bomb personnel determine the threat of detonation of a device/explosives too great to disarm or remove, bomb
personnel, at their discretion, may allow the device to detonate on its own, or detonate it themselves after
appropriate evacuation of the area is completed.
I. At the conclusion of all incidents where bombs/explosive devices or hoax devices are discovered, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will be notified in writing by the Chief of Police on their appropriate forms.
TELEPHONIC BOMB THREATS:
A. Department personnel, usually telecommunications, should attempt to obtain all information available to complete
the “bomb threat checklist.” Call-takers and/or responding officers should obtain the following information:
1. The exact words of the person making the threat that will assist in identifying the person if they have
made previous calls. Many times, callers repeat words or phrases.
a. Call-takers, or reportees should also try and describe the voice of the caller, including speech
rate, impediments, style, slang or profanity used, accents, etc.
b. Did the caller sound familiar to the person receiving the call of the threat?
2. Where the device is reported to be located. This information may help in the location of the device or
in the planning of an evacuation.
3. When the device is reported to detonate.
4. What type of bomb (i.e. dynamite, pipe bomb, incendiary, etc.)
5. What the possible motive for the bomb/bomb threat may be
6. What type of background noise was heard, if any, during the course of the telephonic threat
7. Date and time of the call, as well as duration (length) of call.
8. If there’s a recording of the call available (if threat came in to someone other than dispatch directly)
B. The communications center will immediately notify the Ruidoso Fire Department to respond to stage during each
bomb/incendiary device call. (EMS may also be requested.)

Is the person home and/or do they know that we’re coming?
What is the history concerning reason for standby?
Have a neutral place for officer and complainant to meet before conducting the standby in order to obtain details.

Civil matters in which police become involved have a high potential to become explosive situations, in which the potential
for violence is high. Violence may have already occurred in the past. Some examples of explosive situations are domestic
violence incidents, strikes, landlord-tenant disputes, civil rights violations, boundary disputes, repossessions, and
mechanic’s liens. In most cases the only action that can be taken by police in civil situations is to ensure that no trouble or
fight ensues.
CODE ENFORCEMENT
Response:
1 Code Enforcement Officer
ü What is the location of the code enforcement violation?
ü What is the nature of the violation?
Most Code Enforcement calls are self-generated. Regardless of they are called in by a citizen or officer-generated, a call

ü Do you know who perpetrated the damage?
ü What type of damage occurred?
DOMESTIC/FAMILY DISTURBANCE
Response:
In-progress: 2 PD unit minimum, EMS/Fire to stage if there are reported injuries.
Delayed report (no suspect on scene): 1 PD unit. (If there is potential of the suspect returning, send a second

Is this a verbal or physical altercation?
Any weapons involved? What kind?
Who is involved (husband/wife, parent/child, etc.)?
Has anyone been drinking or taking drugs?
Is anyone injured? Is there a need for an ambulance?
Are the parties involved inside or outside? Have they been separated?
How many people are in the house? If there are other members in the house, ask them to leave if they can do so
safely.
ü Are there children involved? If yes, how many and what are their ages?
ü Do the parties know that police are being called?

ü
ü
ü
ü
ü
ü

Domestic violence is one of the most potentially dangerous calls to which any unit can respond. Make sure that
you are thorough in obtaining all possible information that may be pertinent and get the information to responders as soon
as possible. If the altercation is physical, have the caller stay on line if safe to do so. If the caller advises that they cannot
safely stay on the line to dispatch, ask if they can leave the line open and lay the phone down so that dispatch can hear
what is going on. If the caller is reluctant to answer in detail because the perpetrator is in the same room with them, ask
them simple questions that can be answered with a yes/no response.
***** If the call results in an arrest for domestic violence charges, make sure that the arresting officer completes a Domestic
Violence Notification Form and returns it to dispatch. We are required by law to make notification to the D/V victim upon
the offender’s release. This is per the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) of 1984 . *****

FLOOD
Response:
Combined agency response. Number of responders will depend on size of the flood and number of injuries or
entrapped people. Notify the Emergency Manager and Dispatch Supervisor
ü
ü
ü
ü
ü

Is anyone in danger?
Location of flooding?
Size of flood?
Is anyone trapped?
Are sandbags or barricades needed? (If yes, notify street department)

FUEL SPILL/GAS LEAK
Response:
On-duty fire units. PD units if traffic control is needed, or if spill is result of accident.
Notify State Police if fuel spill is large.
ü
ü
ü
ü
ü
ü
ü
ü

What kind of fuel is leaking (gasoline, diesel, natural gas)?
What is the source of the leak?
Amount of fuel on the ground?
What type of fuel?
Source of the spill?
Is the fuel/gas still spilling or has it been stopped?
If from a vehicle, have the vehicle remain on scene.
If natural gas, have the caller vacate the building.

Small fuel spills or gas leaks can be handled by the fire department and police. State police handles the spill as a HAZMAT
if it is 55 gallons or greater. Local responders are NOT hazmat certified responders, ONLY STATE POLICE. Therefore,
if the spill meets the standard for SP response, SP MUST be dispatched. Natural Gas leaks will require contacting the
natural gas company (usually Zia Gas 378-4277). Additionally, if the gas leak is the result of a pipeline being struck,
additional steps must be taken to insure public and responder safety. There is a separate manual in dispatch that is for
natural gas pipeline emergencies. It is located next to the NCIC manuals.
GAS SKIP
Response:
1 PD unit minimum if the amount of theft is over $50.00, or, if under $50.00 and the caller has driver or license
plate.
ü Suspect and/or vehicle description (including direction of travel and license plate)
ü Amount value of skipped sale
We do not take reports on gas skips under $50.00. Generating a call card and providing the incident number to the calling
party will suffice. If the gas skip is over $50.00 then an officer can be sent for report. The caller will need to provide a
complete description, including license plate number on the suspect vehicle.

When did the offense occur?
Is the suspect still on scene and armed? If not, is it possible the suspect is still in the area?
If the suspect is gone, what is the mode and direction of travel, and how long have they been gone?
Is the victim conscious and breathing?
Where is the victim’s injury?
Does the caller know where the suspect may be or where he may have gone?

If you are EMD certified, administer EMD directions according to the flow charts. If the victim appears to be deceased, per
the caller, notify responding units in order for them to handle the crime scene appropriately as a possible homicide.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS (HAZMAT)
Response:
2 PD unit minimum. 1 EMS and fire unit minimum, State Police HAZMAT officer. (Notify the Dispatch Supervisor
if it is a large enough spill, or complex enough scene that extra comm. personnel may be required.)
ü Can the caller see any placards? What color is the placard? Can they make out any words or numbers on the
placard?
ü What type of hazardous material (exactly) involved?
ü If the spill is the result of a traffic accident, how many vehicles are involved and are they exposed to the hazardous
material?
ü Is the caller involved?
ü What is the caller seeing, hearing, smelling?
ü What is the source of material (tanker truck, barrel, etc.)?
ü What form is the material in (liquid, powder, solid, gas)?
ü Is anyone hurt? Is an ambulance needed?
State police are certified HAZMAT officers and will be notified to respond to ANY HAZMAT SITUATION. Based on placard
numbers and/or colors, determine what type of hazardous material is involved and evacuate the area or handle as indicated
in the yellow Emergency Response Guidebook for hazardous materials. Always advise responders from the initial dispatch
that this is a hazardous materials situation. If the Emergency Response Guidebook indicates that it is a volatile or
dangerous substance, advise responders, and have them stage or keep an appropriate distance. Instruct caller to remain
out of the scene if possible and have them try and keep others from entering the scene. A bystander entering a hazmat
scene to help the injured only creates more exposures and more injuries.

open line. If they are under duress, ask simple questions that can be answered with a yes or no. Make sure to ascertain
if anyone is injured and handle accordingly. If there are injuries and medics are required, advise them to stage. (This
guarantees responder safety as well as scene and evidence preservation.) If possible, ascertain condition of any victims
and provide EMD instruction if you are certified to do so.
DELAYED REPORT (AFTER THE FACT): If the robbery has already occurred, get the time of occurrence and detailed

Shooting calls can be very dangerous for all responders. Obtaining accurate information and disseminating it quickly and
effectively to responding units is critical in minimizing responder exposure and reducing injuries or deaths on scene.
Additionally, obtaining information about the number and types of weapons will make it easier for responders to approach
and/or stage safely out of range.
Shooting calls, especially in progress, will usually have multiple callers, many of whom will be panicked or in shock.
Effective use of calming tactics and caller control will be vital. Additionally, do not discount any information given by any
caller. Sometimes, what may seem to you like an insignificant piece of information, or one that is incorrect, will prove to be
vital and/or life-saving.

Stabbing calls can be very dangerous for all responders. Obtaining accurate information and disseminating it quickly and
effectively to responding units is critical in minimizing responder exposure and reducing injuries or deaths on scene.
Additionally, obtaining information about the number and types of weapons will make it easier for responders to approach
and/or stage safely out of range. Remember, ballistic vests do not stop knives or cutting instruments. Officers have
no “knife-proof vests” in a situation such as a stabbing.
Additionally, stabbing calls, especially in progress, will usually have multiple callers, many of who will be panicked or in
shock. Many people see blood and trauma and will go into hysterics repeatedly. Effective use of calming tactics and caller
control will be vital. Additionally, do not discount any information given by any caller. Sometimes, what may seem to you
like an insignificant piece of information, or one that is incorrect, will prove to be vital and/or life-saving.

Keep the caller calm and reassure them that you are there to help.

Find out if they have taken any action toward suicide, or if they are just contemplating suicide. Do they have the implements
they are considering using on hand? Ask if there is a history of suicide attempt, and if so, why. Do not be afraid to ask
specific questions and try to gain the subject’s trust. Don’t make any false promises or tell them any lies. Try to make sure
that the subject puts any weapons away before responding units make entry. It’s usually a good idea to have an ambulance
staged and on standby in case the subject attempts suicide or tries to harm the responders. (There are subjects who want
to commit suicide “by cop.” In these situations, inform the responders of the subject’s intentions. Often the subjects
become rash, brandishing weapons, etc., in order to force the police to inflict lethal force.)

ü What type of animal?
o If the animal is a raccoon, skunk, squirrel, bat or other similar animal, refer the caller to vermin control.
o If the animal is a wild animal such as a deer, elk, cougar or bear, you will also need to notify Game & Fish
ü What is the complaint? (Is the animal being aggressive? Is it a dangerous animal? Is it a nuisance or traffic hazard?)
o If the animal is a cougar, notify Game & Fish. Dispatch units to get eyes on the animal and verify the public
is not in immediate danger.
o If the animal is a bear, notify Game & Fish. Dispatch units to ensure public safety. Our units will occasionally
scare bears away from populated areas or help remove them to a safer area pending Game & Fish
response.
We generally do not handle wild animal calls unless there’s a danger to the public. Complaints about nuisance bears or
other wild animals (that do not fall under the “pest” category) that are not an immediate public threat will need to be directed
to Game & Fish.
